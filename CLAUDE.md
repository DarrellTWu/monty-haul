# General Good Code Practices

## General Coding Principle: Think Before Coding
Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:

State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.
2. Simplicity First
Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

No features beyond what was asked.
No abstractions for single-use code.
No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
No error handling for impossible scenarios.
If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## General Coding Principle: Surgical Changes
Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:

Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.
When your changes create orphans:

Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.
The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## General Coding Principle: Goal-Driven Execution
Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

"Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
"Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
"Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"
For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

# Monty Haul's Dungeon Crawl

2D PvPvE dungeon-crawl extraction roguelike. Browser-based, multiplayer-first.
D&D 5e SRD mechanics adapted for real-time play.

## Tech Stack
- Client: Phaser 3 (JS) + Vite
- Server: Colyseus (Node.js) — authoritative, single room per run
- Persistence: Supabase (Postgres)
- Assets: Cloudflare R2
- Language: Plain JS with JSDoc @typedef for type safety. No TypeScript.
- Monorepo: npm workspaces (client, server, shared)

## Architecture Rules
- shared/ is the source of truth. All game logic and balance data lives here.
- Server never trusts client. Clients send inputs only; server resolves outcomes.
- No Phaser.Physics. Client renders positions from server state only.
- All tuning values are named constants in shared/data/constants.js or subclass files.
- One module per agent session. Never touch unrelated files.

## Key Commands
- `npm run dev` — starts Vite dev server (client)
- `npm run server` — starts Colyseus server
- `node shared/tests/combat.test.js` — run combat tests

## Agent Task Context
Before any game logic task, read these files:
- shared/types/player.js and shared/types/item.js (data shapes)
- shared/data/constants.js (tuning values)
- The specific file being modified
- A structural reference file if creating something new

## Reference Docs (read when relevant to the task)
- docs/tech_spec.md — Full technical architecture, file structure, module details
- docs/gdd.md — Game design document, combat system, class roster, items

## Code Style
- ES modules (import/export), not CommonJS (require)
- Pure functions in shared/logic/ — no side effects, no framework deps
- Randomness injected via optional rng parameter for deterministic testing
- Named constants for ALL numeric values — no bare literals in logic files
